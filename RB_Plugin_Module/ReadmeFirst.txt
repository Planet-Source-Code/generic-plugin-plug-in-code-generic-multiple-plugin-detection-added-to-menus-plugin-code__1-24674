Plugin_Host.vbp is the host project.

Plugin_Template.vbp is the actual plugin vbp.

Please remember to change the project name for every plugin that you write.
Every Plugin must have it's own unique project name. (Project, Properties)

The Host app will only add (ActiveX EXE) plugin files the begins with "PLUGIN_".

Once you compiled the Plugin to an exe, copy that EXE into the hosts directory and
just double click on it to register it into the ROT.

Oh yes....Don't you DARE forget to vote, or I will not enhance this.....
